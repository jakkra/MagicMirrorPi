Pi MagicMirror
=======
An application to display a GUI behind a observation mirror on an Raspberry Pi. Note: this is an early version, as it might break for other settings than mine.

## Info
At the moment it supports PIR motion detector and DS18B20 temperature sensor.
It displays upcoming buses for some location in Skåne with Skånetrafiken. 
News are pulled from Google News RSS and weather from Yahoo.
